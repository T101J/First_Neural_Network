# First_Neural_Network
My first neural network model in Python, I used the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset. This is a standard machine learning dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository, it describes patient medical record data for Pima Indians and whether they had an onset of diabetes within five years.

As such, it is a binary classification problem (onset of diabetes as 1 or not as 0). All of the input variables that describe each patient are numerical. This makes it easy to use directly with neural networks that expect numerical input and output values, and ideal for our first neural network in Keras. The dataset is included in this repository in the file "pima-indians-diabetes.csv"

I achieved an overall 79.95% accuracy, happy for my first try :)
I also modified the script so it prints the predictions for each input pattern

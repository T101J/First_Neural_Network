# First_Neural_Network
My first neural network model in Python using Keras using the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset. This is a standard machine learning dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository, it shows patient medical record data for Pima Indians and whether they had an onset of diabetes within five years.
